# ADR 0006: Non-destructive migrations

Status: accepted; dry-run inventory, verified single-file streaming, and
side-by-side age-tree and agenix-rekey migration implemented

All recursive inventories share a 10000-entry traversal budget, counting
directories and unrelated files as well as matching leaves. Directory depth is
bounded before recursion, including trees with no ciphertext leaves. This
prevents rejected or empty trees from exhausting memory or the call stack before
the public inventory limit can apply.

Migration is dry-run-first, preserves the source manager, streams plaintext into
native age encryption, verifies every result by round trip, and supports
side-by-side runtime directories. The initial implementation inventories
agenix/ragenix age trees, then provides explicit single-file and bulk age-tree
paths that stream reviewed source ciphertexts through replacement recipients
without materializing plaintext. The bulk path requires an explicit
repository-relative destination, identity, and recipient set; it reports the
complete mapping before execution and opens the identity only for `--execute`.
Every source is staged and round-trip verified before any destination is
changed, then destinations are committed with private backups and rollback on
failure. Legacy files remain untouched for side-by-side activation and rollback
verification. With an explicit repository-relative destination, private
identity, and replacement recipient set, `--execute` performs a side-by-side
bulk rekey of validated `secrets/*.age` sources. It streams and round-trip
verifies every file in one transaction and leaves the legacy tree untouched.

Age-ciphertext migrations distinguish the legacy source identity from the
destination verification identity. `--identity` decrypts the source; the
optional `--verification-identity` (defaulting to it) must match a replacement
recipient and authenticates every staged destination before commit. This keeps
key replacement usable when an old SSH/age identity is intentionally retired,
without weakening the recipient-binding check. Both identities are opened only
for an explicit `--execute`; dry runs never read private key files.

SOPS JSON inspection is similarly non-destructive: it validates bounded
cleartext metadata (including provider and age-recipient declarations) without
decrypting values or invoking SOPS. Structured extraction and mutation remain
separate, explicit operations. The explicit single-document SOPS migration path
uses an absolute non-symlink SOPS binary with an empty environment and an
optional private `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` path. It streams a bounded plaintext stdout
directly into staged native-age encryption and performs its successful-exit
check before the atomic ciphertext commit. A watchdog terminates a stalled
process; SOPS stderr is intentionally discarded so it cannot leak plaintext. The
opt-in single-document PGP bridge is likewise migration-only: it requires an
explicit absolute non-symlink `gpg` executable and an existing owner-only
`GNUPGHOME`, clears the inherited environment, and accepts no passphrase or
secret material in arguments. It runs `gpg` with option-file loading and
automatic key location, import, and retrieval disabled, discards diagnostics,
and streams bounded stdout directly into the same verified native-age
transaction. This does not make PGP a native encryption backend. Cloud/KMS
migrations are not silently enabled through inherited environments and require
their own reviewed capability design.

Clan Vars inspection recognizes the documented per-machine output layout and
never reads values. Because the filesystem leaves do not authoritatively encode
the storage backend, secrecy classification, target selection, or runtime
policy, importing a value requires an explicit reviewed mapping. With an
explicit repository-relative destination, private verification identity, and
replacement recipients, `--execute` streams every value into a staged age
ciphertext batch, verifies each result, and commits side-by-side while leaving
the legacy tree untouched.

Clan Facts inspection recognizes only public `machines/<machine>/facts/<fact>`
leaves. A repository-relative destination plus `--execute` enables a bounded,
no-follow, side-by-side public copy transaction; the source tree remains
available for rollback. Secret facts are backend-defined and require an explicit
reviewed export rather than path inference.

The agenix-rekey adapter consumes an explicit public evaluated export instead of
guessing policy from filenames. It checks the master-to-target boundary,
canonical source paths, target platform, storage mode, recipients, and
repository-only intermediaries. Supplying a separate repository-relative
destination, an absolute private identity, and explicit replacement recipients
enables a side-by-side bulk rekey. As with agenix/ragenix trees, the command
reports its complete mapping first, opens the identity only for `--execute`,
round-trip verifies every staged source, and preserves the legacy tree for
rollback. Clan Facts public leaves are inventoried without reading values;
configurable secret fact stores still require explicit policy mapping. Removal
of a source manager is a separate explicit operation after build, activation,
rollback, rotation, and recovery verification.
