# ADR 0004: Transactional activation

Status: accepted; authenticated generation foundation implemented

Verify all public bindings before decrypting. Materialize every secret/template
into a new private generation and atomically switch only on total success. Use
directory-relative no-follow exclusive operations, reject links and unsafe
parents/modes, and fsync state. Preserve the previous generation on failure and
reload/restart units only after switching. Prefer systemd credentials on NixOS.

The runtime implementation authenticates the complete artifact batch before it
creates a plaintext transaction. It holds no-follow regular ciphertext file
descriptors across hash/signature verification and bounded streaming age
decryption, rejects unsafe roots, sources, modes, and destination ancestry, and
serializes activation with a private no-follow lock. Absolute source paths are
normalized before use; their parent ancestry is inspected for user-owned
symlinks, canonicalized only for root-owned platform aliases, and reopened
descriptor-relatively with `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)`. Each new generation is fsynced
and published under an immutable name before an atomic `current` symlink switch.
Authentication or decryption failure drops the transaction and leaves the
previous generation active.

Runtime-root creation also validates every existing ancestor before calling
`create_dir_all`: user-owned symlink components fail closed, while missing
components are created only after the existing ancestry has passed that check.

Each activation document carries one required phase. Its artifact and template
entries must match that phase, and a template can reference only secret outputs
within the same phase. This gives every phase a separate lock, generation
directory, and `current` symlink. The ordinary `activation` phase retains the
historical runtime root; other phases receive a child root such as
`/run/nix-seal/users`. This avoids overwriting a previously activated early
generation while preventing a later phase from implicitly consuming it.

Secrets may additionally declare one compatibility symlink outside the private
runtime root. The runtime resolves its existing parent by no-follow directory
descriptors, requires the activating user to own a non-group/world-writable
parent, rejects user-owned symlink ancestry before resolving platform aliases,
and publishes the link with atomic no-replace semantics. A pre-existing link is
accepted only when it points exactly to `runtimeRoot/current/<secret>`; regular
files, mismatched links, missing parents, and links inside the runtime root fail
closed. Because the link targets `current` rather than a generation, rollback
updates legacy consumers atomically with the generation switch.

On NixOS, `users` runs after `specialfs` and is an explicit dependency of the
standard user-creation activation script, so its output must be `root:root`. The
normal `activation` phase runs after `users`; `services` runs after it.
`partitioning` is never scheduled by the generic module because its correct
timing and transport depend on the installer. It remains an explicit public
activation spec to be invoked only by reviewed installation orchestration. Home
Manager orders `users`, normal `activation`, and `services` with explicit DAG
edges and phase-isolated roots. Integrated NixOS profiles use private roots
inside the NixOS-managed `noswap` tmpfs; standalone profiles use
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and do not claim a RAM-only guarantee. It rejects
installer-only `partitioning`. nix-darwin continues to reject non-normal phases
until it has platform-specific safe ordering contracts.

Nix modules emit a strict `nix-seal.activation.v2` public document containing a
canonical plan path, target ID, ciphertext/envelope paths, source hashes, and
runtime materialization metadata. Plan hash, target-policy hash,
secret-specific artifact-policy hash, recipient, and per-secret approval keys
and thresholds are not separately configurable: the
Rust bridge deterministically derives them from the validated plan and rejects
any artifact set, permissions, template declaration, or service action that
differs from that target projection. The target identity is configured as a
string runtime path and is never coerced to a Nix path or copied into the store.
The internal Rust `activate` command loads that identity with no-follow,
single-link, owner, and restrictive-mode checks. Runtime generation numbers are
allocated while the activation lock is held, avoiding collisions between
concurrent or repeated activations.

Runtime owner and group names are resolved before a plaintext transaction is
created. The runtime applies the resulting numeric IDs with descriptor-based
`fchown`, then reapplies the restrictive mode with descriptor-based `fchmod` so
ownership changes cannot clear the intended final permission bits or introduce a
path-resolution race. On Unix, destination directories are opened and created
relative to a no-follow transaction directory descriptor with
`openat`/`mkdirat`; the final file uses exclusive `openat` creation with
`O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC`. This keeps parent-directory resolution bound to
descriptors instead of relying on a path re-check between `create_dir_all` and
file creation.

Before publishing, activation compares the complete candidate generation with
the active generation using bounded in-memory hashes plus owner, group, and mode
metadata. An identical candidate is discarded without generation churn. Platform
service actions are declared as bounded unit names and a fixed manager kind. The
runtime resolves the manager executable through a no-follow canonical path,
requires the expected `systemctl`/`launchctl` basename, accepts only the Nix
store or protected operating-system path, and rejects writable/non-executable
metadata before spawning it with a sanitized environment and hard timeout.
Actions are attempted only after a changed generation has switched.

Before switching a changed generation, activation durably records a restrictive
pending-action marker bound to the generation and plan hash. It clears that
marker only after every action succeeds. A failed action therefore does not roll
back the already-atomic secret switch, but the next activation retries the
actions even when the plaintext generation is unchanged. The activation lock
remains held through the switch, action execution, and marker update so
concurrent activations cannot lose or duplicate the pending state. A later
activation that does not carry the same authenticated policy fails closed and
leaves the marker in place; operators must retry the original action set before
it can be cleared. This prevents a plan-only or configuration-only change from
silently skipping a service restart that already failed.

On systemd platforms, a secret may map its runtime path to one or more explicit
`(service unit, credential name)` pairs. The modules emit only
`LoadCredential=name:runtime-path`; plaintext remains outside the unit and Nix
store. A credential mapping automatically adds its service to the post-switch
restart set because systemd credentials are immutable for the lifetime of one
service activation. Duplicate names within a service are rejected across the
entire nix-seal configuration. System-service mappings on NixOS default to
`PrivateMounts=true`, following systemd's recommendation that credential users
receive a private mount namespace. Integrated NixOS Home Manager profiles use a
private subtree of the NixOS-managed `noswap` tmpfs; standalone profiles retain
their session runtime directory and do not claim a RAM-only guarantee. Linux
Home Manager uses the corresponding user-service setting. Darwin and macOS Home
Manager reject credential mappings because launchd has no equivalent contract.

Public runtime templates use the reserved placeholder grammar
`{{nix-seal:name}}`. Placeholder names and their source secret IDs are declared
separately in the activation document; missing, unused, malformed, or undeclared
reserved placeholders reject the complete transaction. A placeholder must select
an explicit `utf8`, padded RFC 4648 `base64`, or lowercase `hex` transform.
UTF-8 validation and all transforms stream from the already-decrypted private
candidate files through zeroizing bounded buffers. Template sources are public,
opened as no-follow single-link regular files, and bounded to 2 MiB; rendered
output is bounded to 128 MiB. Rendered files are created exclusively inside the
candidate generation with the same ownership, mode, fsync, equality comparison,
atomic switch, rollback preservation, and post-switch service semantics as
direct secret outputs.
