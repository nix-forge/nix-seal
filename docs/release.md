# Release controls

Version tags matching `v*.*.*` run the release workflow. The workflow builds the
Nix package natively on x86_64 Linux, aarch64 Linux, and aarch64 macOS, then
publishes the executable, CycloneDX SBOM, SHA-256 checksums, and build metadata
only after a protected `release` environment approval.

The publish job uses GitHub's OIDC-backed build-attestation action. It does not
use a long-lived signing key or package-registry credential. Repository
administrators must configure the `release` environment with the required
reviewers and keep tag creation protected. A 1.0 tag additionally requires the
independent security audit and all gates in [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md); those human
assurance gates are intentionally not replaced by CI automation.

Before tagging, create `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` with a `## Changelog` section
covering functional changes, security impact, affected consumers, migration
notes, verification, and the support and end-of-life window. The release job
rejects a tag without this descriptive record. Each published asset includes
the release tag and platform in its name, and each platform checksum file
covers the executable, SBOM, and build metadata.

To verify a release, download all assets and run the checksum file in the same
directory, then verify the executable's GitHub attestation:

```console
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo nix-forge/nix-seal --dir release-vX.Y.Z
(cd release-vX.Y.Z && sha256sum -c nix-seal-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-linux.sha256)
gh attestation verify release-vX.Y.Z/nix-seal-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-linux \
  --repo nix-forge/nix-seal
```

The expected release identity is the `nix-forge/nix-seal` repository and its
reviewed `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow.

The current Nix package set deliberately omits x86_64-darwin until a supported
nixpkgs/runners combination is available. The platform contract and release
matrix must be expanded when that limitation is removed.
